            <h1>India</h1>
            <p>Deeply traditional yet endlessly surprising, India is one of those destinations that ends up on every traveler's bucket list at some point. They might dream of going to Agra to see the Taj Mahal in all its glory, or exploring the royal palaces scattered throughout Rajasthan. Others find themselves attracted to the jaw-dropping landscapes in Darjeeling and Rishikesh, or the postcard-perfect beaches in Goa.</p>
            <P>There's also India's big cities–New Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata–each of which has its own distinctive personality. It's impossible to get bored exploring the temples, markets, and colorful streets of India's biggest urban centers. The hardest part of traveling to India is figuring out exactly what to see on your journey.

                Whether you're going on an epic backpacking trip or a luxe vacation, plan your adventure with this list of the best places to visit in India.</P>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center"> 1) Agra</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/ind1.jpg" alt="Agra" ><br>
                    
                    <p>If there was just one symbol to represent all of India, it would be the Taj Mahal. The monument inspires millions of tourists to make the trip to Agra every year, waking up before dawn to see magnificent structure radiate at sunrise. But Agra tops the list of the best places to visit in India for reasons that go beyond India's most famous attraction.</p>
                    <p> The city in Uttar Pradesh is chock-full of marvelous Mughal monuments, like Itimad-ud-Daulah's Tomb and Akbar's Mausoleum, decked out in hypnotic inlaid marble designs from top to bottom. Plus, tourists can also see another UNESCO World Heritage Site: the Agra Fort. With so many wonders in just one place, Agra is a must-visit city for tourists in India.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">2)Ajanta and Ellora Caves</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/ind2.jpg" alt="Ajanta and Ellora Caves" ><br>
                    <p>Time travel isn't a reality for travelers quite yet, but you can get pretty close at the Ajanta and Ellora Caves in Maharashtra. Both UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the caves feature intricate carvings from at least 1,500 years ago.

                        The Ajanta Caves are the oldest of the two attractions, featuring around 30 Buddhist cave monuments cut into the rock as far back as the 2nd century BC.
                        
                        Around 100 kilometers southwest, the Ellora Caves contain nearly three dozen Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu carvings, the most famous of which is the Kailasa Temple (Cave 16), a massive structure devoted to Lord Shiva that features life-size elephant sculptures. The magnificent carvings at both sites will leave you filled with wonder.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">3)Mumbai</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/ind3.jpg" alt="Mumbai" ><br>
                    <p>Want to see a more cosmopolitan side of India? Head to the energetic, coastal city of Mumbai–home to ultra-wealthy entrepreneurs and the hottest Bollywood actors. Tourists are never far from five-star hotels or gourmet restaurants in this luxe city. And even if those activities are out of budget, a cruise down the beloved Marine Drive will make you feel like royalty as you catch a glimpse of the scenic coast and glamorous Art Deco buildings.

You can also see a more authentic, local side of Mumbai in the bustling "Thieves Market" or at the Churchgate railway station, where hundreds of thousands of homemade lunches are packed up for delivery to the city's office workers every day.

Make sure you devote a day to checking out Sanjay Gandhi National Park and exploring the 2,000-year-old Kanheri Cave carvings.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">4)Amritsar</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/ind4.jpg" alt="Amritsar" ><br>
                    <p>Amritsar, the "Jewel of Punjab," has made its claim to fame with its remarkable Golden Temple. One of the holiest places in the world for Sikhs, the gilded structure is a sight to behold, glistening in the sun and reflecting into the large pool that surrounds it.

                        The attraction also boasts the world's largest community kitchen, which serves 100,000 diners (including curious tourists!) lentils and curries every day.
                        
                        While in Amritsar, plan to spend an afternoon at the border of Pakistan to see the Beating Retreat Ceremony. Goose-stepping guards from long-term rivals India and Pakistan open and close the border gates at dusk in an over-the-top ceremony you'll never forget. Get there early to dance to blaring Bollywood music with locals in the streets.</p>

                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/ind5.jpg" alt="Goa" ><br>

                    <p>India's not just full of big cities and holy sites–it also has incredible beaches down south in Goa. Its stretches of golden sand along the Arabian Sea offer something for every type of tourist, whether you're interested in hanging out with the backpacker crowd in laid-back beach huts or having a ritzy tropical getaway at a five-star resort.

                        One unique part of Goa is its blend of Indian and Portuguese cultures. You'll experience the fusion throughout the destination, from its Baroque architecture and cathedrals to its spicy vindaloo curries and seafood dishes.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">6)Kerala</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/ind6.jpg" alt="Kerala"><br>
                    <p>Head south of Goa, and you'll trade beaches for tranquil backwaters in Kerala. Nothing beats the experience of hopping aboard a traditional thatched-top houseboat in Alleppey (also known as Alappuzha) and slowly floating through palm-fringed lagoons and rivers, either as a day trip or overnight adventure. You'll enjoy freshly cooked Indian cuisine on the water and breathtakingly beautiful natural sights and wildlife.

                        Easygoing Kerala is like a breath of fresh air from the intensity of cities like New Delhi and Jaipur up north. Schedule some time here when you're in need of a break from the chaos.</p>
