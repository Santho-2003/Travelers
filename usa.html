            <h1>USA</h1>
            <p>The United States is home to some of the most spectacular scenery in the world and some of the most recognizable icons on the planet. Many of the top attractions in the United States are bucket list destinations, drawing visitors from around the world.</p>

             <p>Compiling a list of places to see is step one. But keep in mind, given the size of the United States, most people plan their trips to a specific region, be it the East Coast, the Southwest, the beaches of Florida or California, or outlying regions like Hawaii and Alaska.</p>
                
             <p>You may want to see the city sights, or head out to the top parks and natural areas in the US. In some cases, you can easily combine the two if you plan a day trip or two.
                
                Plenty of options await you, with incredible sights sprinkled across the country. For anyone in the enviable position of having unlimited time and resources, these are the top attractions to include on your US itinerary.</p>
        </div>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center"> 1)Grand Canyon</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/us1.jpg" alt=" Sydney Opera House" ><br>
                    
                    <p>This incredible natural attraction is one of the most visited places in the United States. Carved out by the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon cuts deep into the landscape, creating dramatic cliff walls and ledges. Visitors standing on the rim of the canyon can see down to the canyon floor a mile below, and look out over the ridges and cliffs that run as far as the eye can see.

                    </p>
                    <p>The South Rim, about 4.5 hours by car from Las Vegas, is the most visited section of Grand Canyon National Park. This is where you'll find a large visitor center, regular bus service along the Rim in the high season, and a walkway that runs along the canyon with numerous viewing points and platforms. Several wonderful hikes, including the Bright Angel Trail, leave from here. </p>
                    <p>The Skywalk, a glass bridge leading out over the edge of the Grand Canyon is another popular attraction. It is located at Eagle Point, on the West Rim. This area is about a four-hour drive from the South Rim, but usually less than a 2.5-hour drive from Las Vegas. If you are planning a day trip from Las Vegas, this area is a good option

                        The North Rim, which also has lookout areas, provides a different perspective. This section of the park is less visited and has limited access from November to May due to snow and winter conditions.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">2)Niagara Falls</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/us2.jpg" alt="Niagara Falls" ><br>
                    <p>Situated along the Canada-US border, Niagara Falls is one of the most famous waterfalls in the world. The water from Lake Erie flows into Lake Ontario over these massive waterfalls, known for the great quantity of water that is constantly tumbling over the vertical drop.

                        Niagara Falls is actually a set of three falls: It consists of the largest section, known as Horseshoe Falls, with a drop of 187 feet; a second section on the American side of the river, known as the American Falls, with a drop of 89 feet; and a much thinner section located next to the American Falls, known as Bridal Veil Falls, with a drop of 78 feet.
                        
                        Views are good on both sides of the river, but the Canadian side gives a very different perspective and is worth a visit if you don't mind crossing the border into Canada.</p>
                    <p>Summer is the most popular time to visit Niagara Falls, when the weather is warm, gardens are in bloom, and wandering around is pleasant. Winter provides a unique opportunity to see the snow-covered shores and ice-covered railings, street signs, and trees. It's truly a winter wonderland.

                        On clear days, the plume of mist rising from Niagara Falls can be seen from as far away as the CN Tower in downtown Toronto, Canada, on the opposite shore of Lake Ontario.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">3)Statue of Liberty</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/us3.jpg" alt="Statue of Liberty" ><br>
                    <p>A universal symbol of freedom, the Statue of Liberty is America's most familiar icon and the largest statue in the world. Standing proudly in New York Harbor, visitors can admire the statue from various points around the city, particularly Battery Park, or take a ferry right to the statue.

                        For people who plan to go out to the statue, options include grounds tickets, pedestal tickets, or crown tickets, which allow different levels of access to the site. One of the best options is to take a sightseeing tour and see both the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. A popular tour is the Skip-Line Statue of Liberty & Ellis Island Tour + Pedestal Ticket Upgrade, which will remove all the complexity of visiting this sight.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">4)White House</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/us4.jpg" alt="White House" ><br>
                    <p>The White House is the official residence of the President of the United States, and should be on the top of your list of things to see in Washington. This historic structure has been the home of every president except George Washington. Lafayette Park is on the north side of the White House; beyond is a pedestrian-only zone, full of interesting characters, and an excellent spot to get a great photo.

                        It was originally built by James Hoban in 1792 and, after being burned down by British forces in 1814, was rebuilt in 1818. Tours of the White House are free, but reservations must be made a minimum of three weeks in advance. Strict security rules are always in effect.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">5)Walt Disney World Resort</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/us5.jpg" alt=" Walt Disney World Resort" ><br>

                    <p>This mega amusement park in Orlando is the top family attraction in America, and has been catering to both young and old for decades. Opened in 1971, Walt Disney World has managed to maintain its relevance and its allure for children and even many adults throughout the years.

                        Walt Disney World Resort encompasses not only the various theme parks, it also includes water parks, Downtown Disney with shopping and theaters, and much more, from fine dining to golf. This is a place where you can spend a day or a week.
                        
                        If you feel the need for a bit of sand and surf, the beaches of Florida's Atlantic coast are only an hour away.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">6)Las Vegas Strip</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/us6.jpg" alt="Las Vegas Strip"><br>
                    <p>Walking along the Las Vegas Strip, the main street leading through the city past the mega resorts, is like strolling through an amusement park for adults. Recreations of the New York skyline, the Eiffel Tower, the canals of Venice, and many more foreign sites line this famous street.</p>
                    <p>Beginning at one end with the Luxor Hotel, designed in a pyramid shape, a walk down the street will reveal an erupting volcano and dancing fountains, while inside the resorts are all kinds of oddities and entertainment. Many of the best things to see and do in Las Vegas are sights that can be seen for free.

                        One of the main attractions in Las Vegas is the constant lineup of shows. World-famous singers looking to settle down turn to Las Vegas as a home base, where they perform regularly. Unique performing groups from magic to comedy and acrobatics can also be found here nightly.
                        
                        When you've had enough of the nightlife and city lights, you can still explore the nearby attractions on a day trip from Las Vegas. See nearby Death Valley National Park, Hoover Dam, or Valley of Fire State Park. Explore the desert on hiking trails around Las Vegas, some of which are just minutes from downtown.</p>
