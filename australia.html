            <h1>AUSTRALIA</h1>
            <p>Australia is a land of dreams. From the sacred legends of the Aboriginal Dreamtime, when the great spirits conjured the coral reefs, rainforests, and red deserts, to armchair travelers who describe Australia as their dream destination, the Land Down Under deserves all the hype. The world's smallest continent and largest island, Australia is almost the same size as the United States but with a population the size of New York State and some of the quirkiest wildlife on the planet.

                Australia is also a land of staggering contrasts and spectacular beauty. Along the coast, you can explore vibrant cities, vast sand islands, ancient rainforests, and one of the planet's most awe-inspiring natural wonders: the Great Barrier Reef. In the Outback, rugged national parks and red-earthed deserts offer the ultimate in adventure travel.
                
                Top it all off with a laid-back feel and friendly people, and it's no wonder Australia scores top billing on bucket lists around the world. Create your own adventures with our list of the top attractions in Australia.</p>
             <p>Tourism Australia regularly publishes tourism reports covering key findings from Tourism Australia's commissioned research, Tourism Research Australia’s International Visitor Surveys and National Visitor Surveys, and other tourism supply and demand intelligence gathered from a broad range of sources. The reports serve to cover issues such as:
    
                The value of tourism to the Australian economy
                Industry performance
                Current marketing dynamics; and
                Emerging trends in relation to tourism consumer and trade
                In addition, Tourism Research Australia (TRA) publishes a suite of tourism related reports aiming to equip industry with intelligence to strengthen their marketing and business decisions. Visit TRA’s website for a list of the latest publications.</p>

                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/aus1.jpg" alt=" Sydney Opera House" >
                    
                    <p>Mention "Sydney, Australia" and most people think of the Opera House. Shaped like huge shells or billowing sails, this famous building on Sydney's Bennelong Point graces the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is one of the world's great architectural icons.</p>
                    <p>The location is stunning. Water surrounds the structure on three sides, and the Royal Botanic Gardens border it to the south.

                        Danish architect, Jørn Utzon won an international competition for its design but withdrew from the project after technical and financing problems. Construction was finally completed in 1973 at a cost 10 times the original budget. By this time, Utzon had left the country, never returning to see his magnificent creation.</p>

                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/aus2.jpg" alt=" Great Barrier Reef" >
                    <p>You can't leave Australia without seeing the Great Barrier Reef. This World Heritage-listed natural wonder is one of the largest living structures on the planet. It's so vast, you can see it from outer space. For divers, snorkelers, island aficionados, and nature lovers, it's a bucket list destination.</p>
                    <p>In 1975, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park was established to protect its fragile ecosystems. These include more than 3,000 coral reefs; 600 continental islands, including the beautiful Whitsunday group; 300 coral cays; and inshore mangrove islands.

                    One of the seven wonders of the natural world, the park stretches for 2,300 kilometers along the state of Queensland, on Australia's east coast (that's about the distance between Mexico and Vancouver).
            
                    Not surprisingly, the Great Barrier Reef is one of the best places to visit in Australia for diving and snorkeling.</p>

                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/aus3.jpg" alt="Sydney Harbour Bridge" >
                    <p>Along with the Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of Australia's top architectural icons. Affectionately called "the Coathanger," this impressive feat of construction is the largest steel arch bridge in the world. It was completed in 1932, 40 years before the Sydney Opera House.</p>
                    <p>One of the top things to do in Sydney is a guided ascent to the top of the bridge, where you can enjoy spectacular views over the harbor and city. Rising 134 meters above the harbor, the bridge spans 500 meters, connecting Sydney's North Shore to the central business district. In addition to the pedestrian path, two railway lines extend over the bridge, as well as eight lanes for road traffic, and the direction of each lane can be switched to accommodate traffic flow.
         
                     For an overview on the bridge's history and construction visit the museum in the southeastern pier.
                     
                     Fun fact: Paul Hogan, of Crocodile Dundee fame, worked as a painter on the bridge before rocketing to international stardom.</p>

                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/aus4.jpg" alt="Melbourne's Culture" >
                    <p>Melbourne, Australia's second largest city, is a popular stop on many Australian itineraries – especially for culture vultures. Galleries, theaters, restaurants, shops, and its distinctly European feel are the main draws of this sophisticated city on the Yarra River. It's also a green city, with parks, gardens, and open spaces occupying almost a third of its total area.

                    The cultural highlights of Melbourne are many. Gape at the masterpieces at the National Gallery of Victoria, watch a performance at Arts Centre Melbourne, or head to Federation Square. Here, you can browse Australian artworks at the Ian Potter Gallery and learn about the nation's screen culture at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI).
            
                    Feel like getting back to nature? Follow the Aboriginal Heritage Walk at the Royal Botanic Gardens. And if sports culture is top of your agenda, catch a game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In summer, cricket is the sport of choice; in winter, it's Australian Rules football.
             
                    Melbourne is also rich in history. You can see it in the Grand Victorian buildings funded by the Gold Rush, and you can feel it as you shop in the elegant arcades and the Queen Victoria Market, which has been selling goods to Melburnians for more than a century</p>

                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/aus5.jpg" alt="Blue Mountains National Park" >
                    <p>A UNESCO World Heritage Site, beautiful Blue Mountains National Park is a hiker's paradise and a popular day trip from Sydney. It lies an easy 81-kilometer drive west of the city.</p>
                     <p>Named for the blue haze emanating from the many eucalyptus trees, this stunning park protects more than 664,000 acres of wilderness. On a visit here, you can explore dramatic gorges, waterfalls, Aboriginal rock paintings, and 140 kilometers of hiking trails.</p>
                    <p>The most famous attractions in Blue Mountains National Park are the towering sandstone rock formations called the Three Sisters. Other highlights include the Katoomba Scenic Railway, the world's steepest, which whisks passengers down the Jamison Valley through a cliff-side tunnel into an ancient rainforest; and the Skyway, Scenic Cableway, and Scenic Walkway, which all offer elevated views of the dense forests.

                    Hiking, abseiling, rock climbing, mountain biking, and horseback riding are all popular things to do in the park.</p>

                    <p>Australia Zoo - The Ultimate Wildlife Adventure
