            <h1>Singapore</h1>
            <p>Singapore has been described as a playground for the rich, and it's true that the small city-state does have a certain sheen of wealth. But Singapore offers more than just high-end shopping malls, luxury hotels, and fine dining (though it's worth indulging in those a bit if you can). There is also a vibrant history and diverse ethnic quarters to discover, along with many family-friendly attractions and lovely public spaces that make exploring this slightly futuristic city worthwhile.

                Singapore has an excellent public transportation system that makes sightseeing convenient and easy. Once you've gotten a sense of the metro map, you'll have no problem zipping from one part of town to the next. English is spoken everywhere, and signs are in English as well. In fact, Singapore is one of the easiest and most comfortable countries to navigate in Southeast Asia. And as long as you're not comparing prices to nearby Thailand or Vietnam, you're in for a lovely stay.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">1)Sentosa Island</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/sin1.jpg" alt="Sentosa Island" ><br>
                    <p>Singapore isn't exactly known as a beach destination, but if you're really craving some fun in the sun, Sentosa Island is the place to find it. Siloso Beach is a good spot for getting in beach time, and visitors can play volleyball on free courts or go kayaking and skimboarding. There are several other beach attractions as well, plus an Underwater World aquarium, where you can swim with dolphins.

                        A must-see on Sentosa Island is the Merlion, Singapore's famous statue that has the head of a lion and the body of a fish. You can take an escalator to the top of the statue and enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding area. Adventurous types will want to check out The Flying Trapeze and the SeaBreeze Water-Sports @ Wave House, where you can try your hand at flying strapped to a water-propelled jet pack. </p>
                  
                        The North Rim, which also has lookout areas, provides a different perspective. This section of the park is less visited and has limited access from November to May due to snow and winter conditions.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">2)Singapore Zoo</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/sin2.jpg" alt="Singapore Zoo" ><br>
                    <p>Billing itself as the world's best rainforest zoo, the Singapore Zoo is a pretty impressive place. The facility is clean and inviting, and the animals appear well treated, with plenty of lush vegetation and habitat space.

                        The orangutans are particularly impressive, and visitors can watch as babies and adults alike swing high above their platforms and snack on fruits. There is also a large chimpanzee family, zebras, meerkats, a komodo dragon, mole rats, white tigers, kangaroos, and many other creatures.</p>
                    <p>Guests can observe feedings for some of the animals. Allow at least three hours to make your way around the zoo.

                        If the zoo doesn't satisfy your need for getting close to wildlife, there's also the Night Safari, River Safari (including a giant panda forest), and the Jurong Bird Park. Park hopper passes are available if you plan to visit more than one of the wildlife parks.
                        
                        For a unique and personal wildlife experience, try the Singapore Zoo Breakfast with the Orangutans. This hassle-free tour includes transportation from and to your hotel, allows you half day to explore the zoo, and has an optional upgrade to enjoy breakfast in the company of the zoo's much-loved orangutans.</p>

                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/sin3.jpg" alt="Night Safari Singapore" ><br>
                    <p>Night Safari Singapore puts a new twist on the traditional zoo experience by introducing visitors to the nocturnal lives of the residents. The park's habitats are divided into four sections, each with its own trail that lets you observe these elusive creatures as they go about their "day."

                        The Leopard Trail has, as expected, leopards, as well as lions, flying foxes, civets, and porcupines among other animals. The Fishing Cat Trail tours the habitat of animals native to Singapore, including the fish-loving felines, pangolin, binturong, and other species both common and endangered. East Lodge Trail features Malayan tigers and spotted hyenas, and the Wallaby Trail introduces visitors to the marsupials of Australia.
                        
                        Private tours, buggy rides, and educational sessions are available, as well as once-in-a-lifetime experiences, such as an Asian elephant feeding session.</p>
                    
                </div>
           
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 ">
                    
                    <h2 style="text-align:center">4)Marina Bay Sands</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/sin4.jpg" alt="Marina Bay Sands" ><br>
                    <p>The opulent Marina Bay Sands resort complex includes a high-end luxury hotel, a mall with a canal running through it, the ArtScience Museum, and the Marina Bay Sands Skypark Observation Deck–a vantage point for taking in the entire city. The Skypark's viewing deck and infinity pool are found in the ship (yes, ship) that tops the hotel. Only hotel guests are allowed to use the infinity pool, but anyone can visit the observation deck.

                        From the Skypark, you can see the innovative double helix bridge, the port, the Gardens by the Bay (101 hectares of land converted into waterfront gardens), and the impressive skyline.
                        
                        While up there on top of the city, guests can grab a snack or a coffee at the rooftop restaurant or pick up some keepsakes from the souvenir stand. You can purchase a photo of yourself green-screened in front of the massive hotel as it's all lit up at night, but the cost is steep at 50 Singapore dollars–better to ask a fellow tourist to snap a photo of you if possible. The elegant opulence of the Marina Bay Sands exemplifies Singapore's style and status as a major international city in Southeast Asia.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">5)Chinatown</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/sin5.jpg" alt="Chinatown" ><br>
        
                    <p>If you've ever visited China, Singapore's Chinatown neighborhood will bring you right back here. From the small mom-and-pop stores and authentic Chinese food to the bright red lanterns, there's excitement and hustle in this district. You can visit the Chinese Heritage Centre and see the impressive and beautiful Sri Mariamman Hindu temple.

                      Another temple worth seeing is the Buddha Tooth Relic temple. If you're up early enough (think 4am), you can hear the morning drum ceremony. Or you can just check out the closing ceremony in the evening after viewing the relic.
                      
                      Heritage markers have been installed throughout the neighborhood in English, Japanese, and simplified Chinese, so visitors can better understand the significance of the area. But this neighborhood is not just a testament to the influence of the Chinese throughout Singapore's past. This is a progressive neighborhood (with free Wi-Fi for all), and it's home to the trendy Ann Siang Hill area, where the quaint bistros and upscale boutiques could be at home in any Western city.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align:center">6)Merlion Park</h2>
                    <img  class="img-fluid" src="./images/sin6.jpg" alt="Merlion Park"><br>
                    <p>Singapore's Merlion is just what it sounds like–the figure of a mythical creature that has the head of a lion and the body and tail of a fish. The Merlion represents the city's humble start as a fishing village combined with its traditional Malay name Singapura, "lion city."

                      The structure, which was relocated to Merlion Park in 2002, where it can overlook Marina Bay, weighs 70 tonnes and stands at 8.6 meters tall, spouting water from its mouth in a fountain.
                      
                      The "Merlion Cub" sits nearby, only two meters tall but a hefty three tonnes, and there are five additional official Merlion statues throughout the city. Merlion Park is an ideal spot for photo-ops, whether you are taking a selfie in front of the iconic creature or capturing the magnificent views from the park as it looks out over the bay.</p>
